The producer was looking for a new singer to work with his band Beak&gt;, and it was immediately clear they shared the same musical vision, including a love of punk, dub and 60s girl groups. Just a week later Anika and Beak&gt; (Barrow, Billy Fuller and Matt Williams) went into the studio to begin recording material. The resulting album was recorded in twelve days, live, with the four together in one room. Dub with no overdubs. The collaboration is political, trashy, dub, punk, funk ... a cohesive sound, and and experience in uneasy listening. In the tradition of short-lived but deeply influential 99 Records and the NYC's 80s No Wave nexus, the nine songs on Anika run the gamut from experimental rock (\"Yang Yang\", \"Officer Officer\") to covers of folk (\"Masters of War\") and pop songs (\"Terry\", \"I Go to Sleep\"), while showcasing reverb-drenched ancient drum machine rhythms. The album will be released by Beak's label Invada in Europe, and in USA &amp; Japan by Stones Throw."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Civil_law_and_polygamy_in_namibia> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "[edit] Civil law and polygamy in Namibia Polygamy is the practice of having two or more wives or (less usually) husbands at the same time . The more popularly applied practice of polygamy is polygyny, the practice of having plural husbands, compared to polyandry, having plural husbands. Polygamy was first permitted to rulers as a sign of wealth and prosperity. Many rulers in Africa took to it as it was tradition and part of their culture. Plural wives are customary amongst many ethnic groups in Namibia. \u201CNamibia should address the question of polygamy. It is further said that even countries where there were religious sanctions for such marriages, efforts were being made to discourage them\u201D . This is the controversy of polygamy within the community. Although certain people accept it, others want polygamy to be abolished. And in their defence they state that polygamy may result in the violation of women\u2019s rights. Polygamy is not on par with civil marriage in terms of legal recognition by the state. Only civil marriages are recorded in the marriage register of the Department of Civic Affairs and are accorded marriage certificates, meaning that women in such marriages are not protected by law. A good suggestion to rectify this situation would be for spouses, whether married under polygyny or civil rites, to be accorded equal rights in terms of marriage law because both are merely simple forms of marriage. Discrimination against one form of marriage and recognition of the other will only create irreconcilable conflicts and legal confusion. In conclusion, the state should recognize customary laws and marriages (polygamy) as this is the culture of \u201Cour people\u201D and not try to fight our tradition and heritage as this will bring chaos.

They were written around 1965 and published in 1969, chosen in 1967 with pianist Margaret Nielsen from a folder of similarly brief manuscripts labelled \"crotchety at 51\". They are about twelve minutes long in total. These pieces were among the last that Lilburn composed for acoustic instruments; he began to focus on electronic experimentation in 1965. Each piece is constructed from one or two concise motifs. With a harmonic and rhythmic texture drawing from his electronic music, these pieces explore the full extent of the piano's range and dynamics; \"looking as modern music should look\".

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/STRAT_indicators> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "STRAT indicator The STRAT indicator is a technical indicator, which is based on a set of criteria - and is part of the STRAT technology invented by S\u00F8ren Lanng. The criteria used to form a STRAT indicator can be of any kind and can be derived from any data source - across instruments, timeframes, markets and data types. Typically, the criteria used are derived from traditional technical indicators such as MACD and SMA. Using a set of criteria is well known from strategy development. A trading strategy is fundamentally a set of criteria, used to decide when to take action - each criterion evaluated for true or false. A criterion can be of any type; is SMA10 above SMA20 ? Is it Monday today ? A criterion is either included or excluded from a trading strategy. Fundamentally, a technical analysis consists of a set of criteria which the trader evaluates during the technical analysis. A technical analysis can therefore be regarded as a form of trading strategy - ending up with a trading decision. The STRAT indicator is in it\u00B4s nature a visual backtest of a set of criteria, of a trading strategy, and is used both for automated trading and for technical analysis, across instruments, timeframes, markets and data types. Figure 1 shows a set of criteria, derived from traditional technical indicators, changing value from false to true at differet moments. The leading indicators will be the first to \u201Dtrigger\u201D, the lagging will be the last to \u201Dtrigger\u201D. Figure 2 shows an example of a STRAT indicator, including upper and lower bands. The criteria are turning from true to false at different moments/bars. Using criteria from different timeframes, provides a simple method to create a curve using information from the higher and lower timeframes. Figure 3 shows an example of the SMA4 across timeframes of the same instrument. Figure 4 shows and example of using a set of criteria across both timeframes and instruments, providing a method to perform technical analysis across timeframes, asset classes and markets."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indigenous_education> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Indigenous education refers to the inclusion of indigenous knowledge, models, methods and content within formal and non-formal educational systems. Often in a post-colonial context, the growing recognition and use of indigenous education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of indigenous knowledge and language through the processes of colonialism. Furthermore, it can enable indigenous communities to \u201Creclaim and revalue their languages and cultures and, in so doing, improve the educational success of indigenous students. \u201D Increasingly, there has been a global shift toward recognising indigenous models of education (methods and content) as a viable alternative within the scope of many different education systems. The inclusion of indigenous models of education has come to represent a significant factor contributing to the success of those members of indigenous communities who choose to access these systems, both as students/learners and as teachers/instructors. As an educational method, the inclusion of indigenous ways of knowing, learning, instructing, teaching and training, has been viewed by many critical and postmodern scholars as important for ensuring that students/learners and teachers/instructors (whether indigenous or non-indigenous) are able to benefit from education in a culturally sensitive manner that draws upon, utilizes, promotes and enhances awareness of indigenous traditions."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alejandro_Sawa> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Alejandro Sawa Mart\u00EDnez was a Spanish bohemian novelist, poet, and journalist. Born in Seville, Sawa was of Greek origin. His father was an importer of wine and sundries. After a brief flirtation with the priesthood and a stint at the seminary of M\u00E1laga, he underwent a sudden conversion to vehement anticlericalism and thereafter studied law in Granada. He arrived in Madrid in 1885, \"absurd, brilliant, and starving\". There he led an impoverished, marginal existence. My early days in Madrid were stupendously vulgar - why not say it? - and noble as well. On the same winter day that Pi y Margall anointed me with his reverend right hand, ordaining me into the intellectual hierarchy, I had to sleep in a stairwell on account of having found no place cozier than that in which to take shelter. I know many things about the land called Poverty. But I'm not a complete foreigner to the star-studded infinities that lie beyond. In 1889, he was lured to Paris by its artistic scene. For a time he worked on the staff of the Garnier publishing house, editing an encyclopedic dictionary, and had ample opportunity to strike up friendships with many of the luminaries of Parnassian and Symbolist literature, though he himself preferred the Romanticism of Victor Hugo. He translated the works of the Goncourt brothers and enjoyed what he would later regard as his \"golden years\". He married a Burgundian, Jeanne Poirier, and fathered a girl, Elena. On his return to Madrid in 1896 he plunged headfirst into journalism, serving as editor of El Mot\u00EDn, El Globo, and La Correspondencia de Espa\u00F1a, and as a contributor to ABC, Madrid C\u00F3mico, Espa\u00F1a, and Alma Espa\u00F1ola, among others. His last years were marked by his descent into blindness and mental illness. Ironically, it was this period that yielded his only artistic success, a stage adaptation of Alphonse Daudet's Kings in Exile, in the winter of 1899. His own writings, which were largely journalistic, continued to appear in the most prestigious Spanish newspapers even as his body and mind progressively deteriorated. He wrote, \"I wouldn't have wanted to be born; but I find it unbearable to die. \" He did so on March 3, 1909, blind and insane, in his modest house on calle Conde Duque de Madrid. Shortly before his death, the great bohemian had declared: Death, death! Now it's all I dream about. Dying and going to wherever villainy isn't the prevailing custom, where affirmations and negations at least carry the philosophical sense that lexicons assign to them, where honor starts at the soul instead of the lips. Dying, getting out of here, for dignity's sake, for art's sake, for the sake of self-preservation! I still feel like the healthy one in the middle of this leper colony! Sawa's personality was an inspiration to the novelists of the Generation of '98, notably P\u00EDo Baroja in The Tree of Knowledge and Valle-Incl\u00E1n in Bohemian Lights. Max Estrella, the protagonist of the latter, was largely inspired by Sawa, who, though outwardly uncultivated, possessed a forceful personality and a style redolent of Hugo and Verlaine, men whom he would claim as his personal friends, along with Alphonse Daudet, Rub\u00E9n Dar\u00EDo, and Manuel Machado. (The latter would compose an epicede in his honor. ) After Sawa's death, Valle-Incl\u00E1n wrote to Rub\u00E9n Dar\u00EDo: I've mourned for him, for me, for all the poor poets. I can't do anything, neither can you, but if enough of us were to join together we could do something. Alejandro left a book unedited. The best he's ever written. A journal of hopes and woes. The failure of every attempt he made to get it published, and a letter from El Liberal rescinding an assignment worth seventy pesetas, were what drove him mad in his final days. A desperate madness. He was on the verge of killing himself. He died like a king in a tragedy: mad, blind, and furious. &#8212;Ram\u00F3n Mar\u00EDa del Valle-Incl\u00E1n. Posthumously published in 1910 with a prologue by Rub\u00E9n Dar\u00EDo, Iluminaciones en la sombra marked a modernist departure from the naturalist style in which he had written his earlier novels: La mujer de todo el mundo (1885), Crimen legal (1886), Declaraci\u00F3n de un vencido (1887), Noche (1889), Criadero de curas (1888), and La sima de Igusquiza (1888)."@en .

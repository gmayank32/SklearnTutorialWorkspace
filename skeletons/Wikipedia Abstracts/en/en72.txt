Aw-li On-nam Ot-tjin (or simply Otjin) is a traditional mancala game played by the penihing people of Borneo. The first transcription of the rules of the game is due to norwegian ethnographist Carl Sofus Lumholtz. Despite its origin, Otjin is similar to african mancalas such as Ba-awa and quite different from most asian mancalas.

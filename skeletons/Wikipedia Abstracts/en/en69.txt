Joseph Boze, a French portrait and miniature painter, was born at Les Martigues about 1746. He painted the portraits of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, and, being devoted to the court and the royal family, narrowly escaped the guillotine. He was thrown into prison, but the fall of Robespierre set him at liberty, and he came to England, where he remained until the restoration. He died in Paris in 1826. His own portrait is among his drawings in the Louvre.

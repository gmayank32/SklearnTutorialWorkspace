Endodoi is a traditional mancala game played by the Maasai people of Kenya and Tanzania. It is very close the Ayoayo game of the Yoruba people of Nigeria, although there is no evidence of a direct relationship between the two. Maasai are well know to play Endodoi very quickly, to the point that an external observer may find it hard to even distinguish individual moves and turns.

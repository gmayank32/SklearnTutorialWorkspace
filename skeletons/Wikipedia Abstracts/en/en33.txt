The Hinniegram is designed to aid medical doctors in the interpretation of blood gas results. It was invented by John Hinnie a consultant in endocrinology and diabetes who also trained in biochemistry. Many doctors (particularly junior doctors) find blood gas result interpretation difficult and the Hinniegram helps to simplify this process.

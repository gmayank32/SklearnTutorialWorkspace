|} The Duisburg-Ruhrort-Mönchengladbach railway is a historically significant, but now partly abandoned line in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The line was built by the Ruhrort-Crefeld District Gladbach Railway Company Railway, founded in 1847, and is one of the oldest lines in Germany. The greater part of the route, along with the western section of the Ruhr line of the Rhenish Railway Company (Rheinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, RhE), forms the Duisburg–Mönchengladbach line, one of the main line in Germany’s lower Rhine region, connecting the stations of Duisburg and Mönchengladbach.

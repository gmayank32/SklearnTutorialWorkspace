Emil Diesen (1880 – 1942) was a Norwegian writer. His largest work was Norsk industri- og næringshaandbok, a registry of several branches of Norwegian industry and business. It was released in several volumes between 1917 and 1921. A volume was dedicated to mechanical workshops, others to the finishing industry, paper industry, mining and metallurgic industry, timber industry, textile industry, sports equipment manufacturing, construction and food and beverage industry. There were also handbooks for the banking and insurance industries, and one volume covered the press and journalists in Norway at the time. He later issued several yearbooks of "exchange rates of the world", and his last books were about the banks of specific counties. He was a son of captain Ernst Georg Diesen (1841–1908), brother of Andreas Melchior Seip Diesen, first cousin of Henry Diesen, uncle of Ernst Diesen and granduncle of Andreas Diesen.
